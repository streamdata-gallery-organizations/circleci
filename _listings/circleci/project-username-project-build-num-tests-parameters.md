  title: CircleCI
  description: The CircleCI API is a RESTful, fully-featured API that allows you to
    do almost anything in CircleCI. You can access all information and trigger all
    actions. The only thing we don&rsquo;t provide access to is billing functions,
    which must be done from the CircleCI web UI.
