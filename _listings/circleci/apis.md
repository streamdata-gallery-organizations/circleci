  but maintaining speed can be difficult as apps and systems grow larger and more
  complex. CircleCIrsquo;s platform allows developers to rapidly release code (for
  web and mobile apps) they trust by automating the build, test, and deploy process.
  CircleCI enables developers to detect and fix bugs before they even reach customers.
